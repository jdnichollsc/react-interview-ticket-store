## Features

The goal of this project is to have a functioning ticket store \
But there is a lot that needs to be done!

### Goals :

- Have a artist selector, populated with different artists
- Have a functioning concert selector, populated with different concerts for each artist
- Have a functioning ticket type (plan) selector, populated with different ticket plans
- Have a functioning input parameter, where user can say how many tickets they want
- Caclulate total correctly
- Write jest tests

### Nice to Have

- Format the total for US currency. Research how this can be done
